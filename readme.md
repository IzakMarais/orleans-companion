# Orléans helper site

This is a fan made companion site for the [Orléans](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164928/orleans) boardgame. 

## Setup helper

The setup in Orléans normally requires 
* different types of goods tiles to be *shuffled together*, 
* certain quantities randomly selected based on player counts
* certain quantities randomly removed based on player counts
* and the remaining tiles *sorted by type again* to form a supply.

The setup helper aims to bypass this shuffling and resorting by calculating randomized setup numbers for selected and removed goods tiles.
